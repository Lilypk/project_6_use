# Countries API 

## Description 

Countries API is a project where I built out a JSON API from beginning to end! Using data from the Countries API, I choose five different countries each having a name, capital, region, and language. This project is just a fun way to learn about a few different countries with features including a blank card for you to build a new country, delete a country, or update a country!

## Example

REST API Docs:

GET / - Root that will redirect you to /countries.

GET /countries - Show information.

GET /countries/:name - Search by name. For example, to search for Spain- /countries/name/spain.

GET /countries/:id - Search by ID. For example, to search for Spain which has the ID of 5fa1ad6fb0866067a72b3651- /countries/5fa1ad6fb0866067a72b3651. 

POST /countries - Create new information. 

PUT /countries/:id - Update a country. You will need to search by ID. 

DELETE /countries/:id - Delete a country. You will need to search by ID. 


## Features

To start out at the Bronze level I built my model and linked it to the database. Then I got my data from the API, seeded the database using my model, and finally built my routes.


## Technologies

For this project, I used Mongoose and Express. As well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

### Installing 

To set up this project you will first need to fork my repo by clicking on Fork in the top right corner and choosing where to fork to. Then you will click Clone or Download and copy the url. Next open your terminal and change to the directory you wish to work on the project. Here you will run the command 'git clone' followed by pasting the url you just copied. Hit enter. You can now change to the project repo. You can now run node index.js and open your code editor. In your chrome browser, go to localhost:9002.
